# The Meditation Club
## HTML/CSS Essentials Project 1

![Responsive](/readme-resources/images/Responsive.png)

The meditation club is a place where anyone can become free from stress and become happier in their life. The club not only holds meditation lessons, but also holds talks every week about ancient indian wisdom. With a combination of knowledge and meditation one can become happy. 

This website allows one to get a basic understanding of what the meditation club is, along with the timetable for the clubs events. The website allows one to sign up. Lastly the website shows social media links in the contact section to get in touch.

The website is a concept design and is not used for a real life buisness. The aim of this project was to build a aesthetically pleasing website which is responsive on all devices.

# UX
<hr>

## Owner Buisness Goals
The goal of this website is to introduce others to Meditation from all angles. This would be from physically learning diffrent styles of meditation, learning the culture behind meditation and the ancient teachings behind mediation. The website is a place where one can get a summary of what the club entails, but also allows one to check the schedule of what is on every week. If one is interested then they can sign up on the website or get in touch via the social media links. 

## Customer Goals
<hr>

### New Customer Goals
1. New users should be able to get a summary of what the meditation club is about.
2. New users should be able to easily check the timetable to see what would interest them most about the meditation club.

4. New users should be able to access the clubs social media to either contact or find content for context of what the events look like. 


### Returning Customer Goals
1. Returning users may have already gathered what the club is about, so the about section is more of way of reiterating what the club does. 
2. The main reason most returning users would go back to the website would be for the timetable to see what is on that coming week or to access social media links.


## Owner Buisness Story

1. The buisness values must be presented via the website. The real value is a modern take on ancient teachings.

## Testing
<hr>

### Functionality/Compatibility Testing

For functionality testing I tested my website in all diffrent sizes in chrome, firefox and safari. 

In chrome the site looked just fine on all devices.

- Used dev tools to check everything works with diffrent screen sizes. all seemed to be fine. 
- All areas have great contrast and seem to be easy to see.
- Form works fine and submit button works. Did find a bug with the hover function of the button being out of place. Fixed below in bugs section.

However in Safari and firefox all looked fine apart from the nav bar font which looked slightly thinner then usual. This was the same accross all device sizes.

![safari-blurry](/readme-resources/images/safari-blurry.png)

Result: After speaking with external help (tutors) We came to a conclusion as it's just the way the browsers render. Possible change of font could fix in the future. 


### Code Validator Testing

 [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
 [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

Before hover:

![signup](/readme-resources/images/signup.png)

After Hover: 

![submit-hover-bug](/readme-resources/images/submit-hover-bug.png)

**Solved Bugs**

Hover Bug:

Removed from #submit-button:hover:
margin-top: 5%;
padding: 1% 1%;


added to #submit-button:hover:
display: block;
margin: 1% auto;

- I must have missed this when adjusting the submit button code in css.
